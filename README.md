# Five in a Row

## Objective

> Make a game where you have to make a line of 5 given that each player has a turn each.

> Was prompted to play on snapchat but playing on snapchat was annoying.

## Functionality

> Neat Object-oriented programming :)

- Draw Grid
- Mouse listener to see which cells drawn
- Make unique player shapes
- Create controller to indicate turns

## To do

- Check if current player wins
    - Refactor code to use Point class
    - Cell class needs to be able to retrieve surrounding cells (use coordinates)
        - Create cell dict when initialising cells to call cells
            - Make Grid into a Singleton (errors)
- End game sequence
